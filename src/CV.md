## Employment

### Dennis
_Digital Publishing_

> Front End Team Lead *(Jan 2017 - present)*

* Integral involvement in migration of legacy Drupal sites to decoupled React / Graphql architecture
* Implementation of Apollo mock server and associated helper functions to aid concurrent development practices  
[Examples of using Apollo Mock Server to aid development and automate testing _A core part of the platform's business requirements is the ability to inject various elements (ads etc) inbetween content blocks. Without the ability to specify what mocked data was returned developers struggled to add new elements and we weren't able to release confidently due to inability to run automated tests against the logic.  
I implemented functionality to allow us to control this mock data (mainly during Zoom conference calls, while still concentrating on the meeting obviously :innocent:) which had very positive feedback from developers and which allowed the QA team to incorporate the functionality into their testing_](/examples/mocking#example)
* Initial setup of rules engine to inject ads etc. in article content
* Creation of automated testing tooling using CodeceptJS / Puppeteer for use by developers and QA technicians across portfolio of sites  
[CodeceptJS example _Description_](/examples/codeceptjs#example)
* First point of call for queries and guidance on techniques / processes within team, with a focus on
overseeing adoptation of new technologies
* Line management and personal development of staff
* Onboarding of remote team based in Kiev
* Oversight of transitioning to React from Riot on [buyacar.co.uk](https://www.buyacar.co.uk)
* Implementation of Google Optimize experiments; including creating 'Optimize Ready' event listener  
[We had a requirement to change our search API call depending on whether an Optimize experiment was running. _To achieve this I modified Google's page hide snippet to fire an event once Optimize had loaded, and modified our search call to wait for this event.   
I later turned this functionality into an NPM package (which no-one has ever used)_](/examples/optimize#example)
* Oversight and implementation of Front End aspects of Buyacar embeddable widget  
[This widget is used across the business's other automotive websites to drive traffic to Buyacar from related vehicle reviews :car::moneybag: _The Front End side was built by myself and a junior member of the team who had little javascript experience. The developer picked up the concepts of building DOM elements from a JSON object well (and is no longer a junior dev, woo! :beers::cocktail::beers::cocktail:)_](/examples/buyacarwidget#example)

> Front End Developer *(Jan 2014 - Jan 2017)*

* Front End ‘point person’ on major site launches including [alphr.com](http://www.alphr.com), [theweek.co.uk](http://www.theweek.co.uk) and [buyacar.co.uk](https://www.buyacar.co.uk)  
[Homepage layout on Alphr using Flex. _This was one of the first times we were able to use flex on one of our sites (thanks to us being allowed to drop support for IE10). I now use flex for **everything**, I'm a flexbox addict.  
I made several layout mixins whilst working on this page (full-width-elem, equal-rows) which are now used by team members across a number of sites (and which could probably do with improving to be honest)_](/examples/alphr#example)
* Responsible for maintenance and enhancement of Front End areas of Drupal distro, including implementation of modular [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) architecture across portfolio
* Creation of proof of concept "Sticky Interscroller" ad format to be pitched to clients  
[This proof of concept was made in collaboration with one of our Product Managers who wanted to find a way to improve advert viewability. _So far I've not found a way to deal with the slight jerkiness caused by iOS's buggy position:fixed; implementation. This upsets me greatly :crying_cat_face:  
To my knowledge we've not actually sold any of these formats but it was fun to make_](/examples/stickyinterscroller#example)
